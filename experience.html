                                <p>I created a game named Skyfire to be played for fun and leisure. The game follows a
                                    Wizard which is the player who must defeat different enemies and The Necromancer to
                                    save villages and rid evil from the land of Skyfire. The player can use various
                                    spells during battles and roll dices to determine their power. The adventure game
                                    was made using Java programming.</p><br>
